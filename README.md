# Sk-Perm

**Sk-Perm** gives you the freedom to deal with permissions and groups. You can add/remove permissions to/from players as well as groups. You can also add/remove players to/from groups.

This add-on is linked into permission plugins using Vault. Because of this, there are no syntaxes specific to a certain permission plugin, and should work with any permission plugin that is linked into Vault.

# DEPRECATION NOTICE:
Sk-Perm is no longer active.    
Please instead use **PermSK** by iPlexy. This addon is an updated, working fork of Sk-Perm.
